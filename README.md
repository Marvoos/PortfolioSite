## Description

Built entirely within the standard __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JavaScript__ languages, the purpose of this website is to compile my website development and job experience as well as my computer science education into a user-friendly format accessible to everyone.

As a perfectionist and creative who takes an active interest in creative design, the production of this portfolio has been a long and arduous journey.

While I am still learning a ton about the backend and features of JavaScript, I will apply my knowledge and learn as much as I can.

## Learning Goals

- Learn about the __CSS__ attributes and properties that make a website accessible through each browser.
- __Experiment__ and __learn__ more about _dynamic graphics_ in JavaScript using the __canvas element__.
- Develop a better understanding of dynamic elements in JavaScript through built-in methods and functions.

| 01/27/2026 | Website theme | Liking the styling so far, however, whitespace seems to be hard on the eyes. |
| 01/28/2026 | Website controls | After finishing the buttons, it seems that I could reuse this component for future projects. |
